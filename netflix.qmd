## Exploring the Most Popular Programming on Netflix

**New York, NY, September 28, 2025:** During this past decade, viewers have been showing more and more interest in both foreign and non-English films like the award-winning film *Parasite*, and the massively popular show *Squid Games* (both currently offered on Netflix). To keep up with this growing demand, Netflix has invested and expanded globally, partnering with companies and studios to add high-quality films and shows to its offerings.

This week, *Kpop Demon Hunters*, *Wayward*, *She Said Maybe*, and *Billionaires' Bunker* are leading the top 10 on its platform for English movies, English shows, non-English movies and non-English shows, respectively. Netflix continues to dominate the top 10 on its' platform this week as every #1 title is a Netflix Original. This leads to some further questions about Netflix and their performance between its English and non-English content. Is Netflix seeing non-English content outpacing English content in terms of growth and viewership?

## Aquiring Data

In order to answer these questions, we will use the language R to set up and analyze our findings. First, let's prepare the foundation to answer these important questions. There are two files we will use to analyse and find our answers, from [Netflix's TuDum Top 10](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10){style="color: red;"}. The two files are Global Top 10 and Country-wide Top 10, both important for finding popularity of films and shows on a large and smaller scale. We will also use multiple libraries to analyze as well, such as *tidyverse*, *knitr*, and *DT*.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
#| output: false
#| warnging: false
#| messsage: false

# Create folder
if (!dir.exists(file.path("data", "mp01"))) {
  dir.create(file.path("data", "mp01"), showWarnings = FALSE, recursive = TRUE)
}

# Download global file
global_file <- file.path("data", "mp01", "global_top10_alltime.csv")
if (!file.exists(global_file)) {
  download.file("https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/data/all-weeks-global.tsv",
                destfile = global_file)
}

# Download country file
country_file <- file.path("data", "mp01", "country_top10_alltime.csv")
if (!file.exists(country_file)) {
  download.file("https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/data/all-weeks-countries.tsv",
                destfile = country_file)
}

# Download libraries
packages <- c("tidyverse", "knitr", "kableExtra", "DT")

for (pkg in packages) {
  if (!require(pkg, character.only = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(pkg, repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org/")
    library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
  }
}

library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(DT)
library(scales)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Data Importing and Setup

### Importing and Cleaning

After downloading the files, and setting up the libraries, its time to import these files and get a feeling of the data.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| results: hold
#| include: true
#| output: true
# Read data files
invisible(suppressMessages(GLOBAL_TOP_10 <- read_tsv(global_file)))


#Describe the data, with four instances

summary_tbl <- tibble(
  Column = names(GLOBAL_TOP_10),
  Type = sapply(GLOBAL_TOP_10, class),
  Example = sapply(GLOBAL_TOP_10, function(x) toString(head(unique(x), 4)))
)

kable(summary_tbl, caption = "Global Top 10 Overview")

cat("Number of rows:", nrow(GLOBAL_TOP_10), "\n\n")
```

Everything looks good at an initial glance. However, it's always important to make sure that the formatting within a data set is correct, or there can be issues. These missing values (commonly known as NA or Not Available) do not follow the formatting that R detects. </span> We can replace "N/A" or "NA" strings with proper NA values either by [mutating]{.custom-tooltip}[Adds or modifies columns in a data frame by computing new variables.]{.custom-tooltiptext} the column after import or specifying them when reading the file.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
#| output: false

# Count N/A and NA strings before mutation
na_string_count_before <- sum(GLOBAL_TOP_10$season_title %in% c("N/A", "NA"), na.rm = TRUE)
na_count_before <- sum(is.na(GLOBAL_TOP_10$season_title))

# Mutating the season_title column
GLOBAL_TOP_10 <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |>
  mutate(season_title = if_else(
    is.na(season_title)
    | season_title == 'N/A',
    NA_character_,
    season_title
  ))
# Replacing ALL N/A with NA  

COUNTRY_TOP_10 <- read_tsv(country_file, na = c("N/A", "NA"))


```

Now that we changed the data, lets quickly look if the NA values changed.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| results: hold
#| include: true
#| output: true


# Count NAs after mutation
na_count_after <- sum(is.na(GLOBAL_TOP_10$season_title))

cat("In 'season_title' column:\n")
cat(" - Number of 'N/A' or 'NA' strings before mutation:", na_string_count_before, "\n")
cat(" - Number of NA values before mutation:", na_count_before, "\n")
cat(" - Number of NA values after mutation:", na_count_after, "\n")
```

After mutation, the column now uses the proper NA values. This ensures that during future analyses we can handle the missing data correctly.

## Initial Data Exploration

Lets look at a larger sample of the data, since there are 8,800 rows:

```{r}
format_titles <- function(df){
    colnames(df) <- str_replace_all(colnames(df), "_", " ") |> str_to_title()
    df
}

GLOBAL_TOP_10 |> 
  mutate(`runtime_(minutes)` = round(60 * runtime)) |>
  select(-runtime) |>
  format_titles() |>
  slice_sample(n = 25) |> 
  datatable(options = list(pageLength = 5,
    lengthMenu = c(5, 10, 20, 25),
    searching = FALSE, info = FALSE)) |>
  formatRound(c('Weekly Hours Viewed', 'Weekly Views'))
```

While it is nice to see what the table looks like, there are not many insights about Netflix's Top 10 lists that are available from only looking at 25 random entries. Lets take a closer look.

After looking into and analyzing the data, one thing is clear: Netflix has a massive variety of shows and movies, and these are just the ones that have hit the top 10. Currently, it operates in **`r num_country[[1]]`** different countries.[^1] However, the streaming platform did cease its operations in **`r country_ceased`**, exiting the market on `r cease_date`, for a total of only **`r weeks_ceased`** weeks this year.[^2]


Despite this, global content is still proving to be very successful. For example, the top global non-English film is *`r top_film_title`*, an anti-war film set in World War 1. It spent a total of **`r top_film_weeks` weeks** in the top 10, or equivalent to almost half a year.[^3] And its not the only global sensation; many other films have been incredibly successful like the Korean survival drama *Squid Game*. It has achieved a total of **`r squid_game_views`** views across its three seasons globally.[^4] But which film is the longest? Well, *`r longest_film_name`* is the clear winner, with an impressive `r longest_film_min` minute run time. [^5] The strength of Netflix's foreign content doesn't end there, surprisingly. The show *Pablo Escobar, el patrón del mal* has 102 successive weeks being in the top 10. Not only does the show has the longest successive run in the top 10, but this achievement is split between **five** different Latin American countries (shown below). The show *Pablo Escobar, el patrón del mal* shows how quality serialized content can sustain attention and create strong audience loyalty.



```{r}
#| echo: true
# Code to calculate longest uninterrupted weekly run in the top 10
COUNTRY_TOP_10 |>
  filter(category == 'TV') |>
  arrange(country_name, show_title, week) |>
  group_by(country_name, show_title) |>
  mutate(
    week_diff = as.numeric(week - lag(week)),
    group_id = cumsum(ifelse(is.na(week_diff) | week_diff != 7, 1, 0))
  ) |>
  group_by(country_name, show_title, group_id) |>
  summarise(successive_weeks = n(), .groups = "drop") |>
  group_by(country_name, show_title) |>
  summarise(longest_successive_run = max(successive_weeks), .groups = "drop") |>
  slice_max(longest_successive_run) |>
  rename(
    `Country` = country_name,
    `Title` = show_title,
    `Longest Successive Run (Weeks)` = longest_successive_run
  ) |>
  kable("html", caption = "What TV show had the longest uninterrupted weekly run in the top 10?") |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F)

```

Now lets put some focus on English and US content. *`r most_countries_title`* is the show with the widest appeal country-wise, debuting in the top 10 for `r most_countries` different countries.[^6] Many fans across the globe were eagerly waiting for the release of *`r most_countries_season`*, and it definitely shows. Popularity of English language shows doesn't end there, with the comedy hit *Red Notice* reaching **`r red_notice_views_2021`** views in 2021 alone.[^7] Interestingly, some films weren't an immediate hit but instead gained momentum over time. A total of **`r num_late_risers`** films reached the #1 spot after debuting at a lower rank on the weekly chart.[^8] The most recent film to do this was *`r recent_late_riser`*, giving one more example how sometimes films need time to build their audiences even if their program wasn't an initial smash hit.

Finally, lets answer the question: which content has been viewed the most on Netflix’s streaming platform? Looking below, *Squid Game*, a TV and non-English show, is the clear victor. It beats Stranger Things by over 2 billion total hours watched, and makes Films' viewership look tiny with those only being in the hundreds of millions. However, it is important to note that TV shows have multiple episodes, often being an hour long or more. Because of this, it takes more hours to finish a TV show compared to films and will have heavily inflated numbers. English content still does have an upper hand on the film side, with *KPop Demon Hunters* having almost double the hours watched of *Society of the snow*.

### Stranger Things: Dominating the past and the future as Season 5 Approaches

**New York, NY, October 1st, 2025:** The show *Stranger Things* has been one of Netflix's most popular shows worldwide, consistently ranking among Netflix's most watched shows since its introduction in 2016. Across its first four seasons, the series has achieved a total of **`r stranger_hours_f`illion** hours watched, with fans clamoring for season five its sure to rise even more.[^9] *Stranger Things* also spent almost half a year in the top 10 in 2022(as shown below), and has had clear global success with season 4. It even sparked newcomers to join in on the release of season 4, with seasons 1, 2, and 3 all reaching the top 10 at the same time as season 4 for three months. Overall, *Stranger Things* has such a strong presence and viewership, beating *Wednesday*, *Bridgerton*, and *Inventing Anna*. Its average rank is 4.44, but including all seasons of Stranger Things lowers this value, since earlier seasons are counted again when they re-enter the top 10. The highly anticipated fifth Season of *Stranger Things* will release four episodes on November 26th, three episodes on December 25th, and a finale episode on January 31st.
